 Chumpy's simple rankings v1.0
===============================

This is designed to be an addon for my simple Cabal regpage v1.0 or my
Cabal Cash Shop. It can work without them with some simple modding.

I'm only releasing this because it is going to be a while before what
i have planned will be ready and people keep asking me for rankings.
None of this is well optimised and it uses far too many queries i know
(especially for the sucky TG page) but this is only a rough outline i
put together quickly and i wasn't actually planning on releasing it for
a while yet. You want it early don't expect it to be nicely polished :P

This uses the regpage stylesheet and config so if yours is modified
the rankings will have the same style.


 Insta... err, copying
=======================

Place rankings.php in the same folder as the reg.php on your webserver.

If your regpage is www.mywebs.com/reg.php your rankings page is
www.mywebs.com/rankings.php. Same thing with the cash shop.
